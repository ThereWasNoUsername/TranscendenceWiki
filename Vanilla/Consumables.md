## Damage type enhancers
A Damage type enhancer affects a weapon of a given damage type and is known under various names based on corresponding damage type. When invoked, it attempts to enhance the current primary weapon. Assuming that the damage type matches, a damaged weapon is repaired while an intact weapon increases its damage by 10%.
